"""per-tenant audit chain

Tenant isolation made a single global hash chain untenable: verifying tenant A's chain
would require reading tenant B's entries, and A's evidence package would carry B's
digests. `seq` therefore becomes unique per (org_id, seq) and each tenant owns a chain
starting at 1.

Existing single-tenant deployments are unaffected — every row already carries
`org_default`, so the existing chain simply becomes that tenant's chain, unchanged and
still verifiable.
