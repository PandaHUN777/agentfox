 * The last line of defence: a render or fetch threw somewhere no page caught it.
 *
 * Next replaces the page body with this and keeps the shell (sidebar, topbar)
 * around it, so the reader keeps their bearings instead of losing the whole app
 * to a blank screen. Two jobs only — say in plain words what failed, and offer
 * the one action that can recover it (`reset()` re-renders the segment, which
 * retries every fetch the page made).
